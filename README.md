Tron Game in Libgdx... I have no idea how to use libgdx, so don't expect beautiful, logical or working code

I don't feel like rewriting all the collision/movement/rendering/everything to make this a grid game to implement an ai, and I don't feel like figuring out a good 2 player input mehtod for phones, so I think I'm done with this for a while.

This code is broken in many ways. This code is ugly, has terrible design choices and is inefficient. If you want to use it, it's your funeral.
